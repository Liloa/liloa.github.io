So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

Im actually extatic that Javascript was not my first promming language that I learned because it is so terribly easy to learn and use, well compared to Java and C/C++ at the least. This coming from a person who has yet to do anything with real substance using javascript. All Ive done is create some short functions and finish ~10 hours worth of javascript tutorials. Though out of what I have done, javascript has been enjoyable. I now have more reason to use chrome other than just because it is made by google.

Javascript in this first module of ICS 314 Software Engineering has been okay so far, the Workouts Of The day (WOD) have not been that bad so far in my opninion. At first they seemed intimidating because of the timer and the credit/ no credit approach when taking them. I hope to learn more javascript and more skills associated with it soon so I can make something from scratch just for fun because doing that is something I have not had the opportunity to do before. Javascript seems like a good start at programming that is flexible and can do things that other languages cannot.

Athletic software engineering that we practice is going okay, it is not anything too fancy. We get practice WODs and they help us by getting into the groove of how a WOD works and how to work in the time that is given to us. The main stressor of the WODs are the fact that we have no idea what we are walking into until it is time to work on it. I like to think of it like an improv speach, you can practice all you want but when time comes you have to think on the spot and hope you have the knowledge required to get the work done. I do not really find it enjoyable but hey it seems like a challenge, and challenges only make you stronger... unless they break you and you lose all hope of course.
