Being ethical is basically doing the right thing. Not justice or being right but doing what is the right thing that should be done for the people around you, your community. Having a good ethic could mean being responsibly for the responsibilities that one may have taken on as a task, being known to be a trustworthy person who others can vouch for, knowing that creating and circulating the next advanced new ransomware is something that one should not do, and knowing that your actions will have some kind of effect on society in one way or another.
