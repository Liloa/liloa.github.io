Now, describe two problems you’ve encountered while developing the digits application. Ideally, you will discuss one problem you had and how you solved it, and one problem you are currently having that you haven’t solved yet.

Alternatively, you can present two problems you’ve solved, or two problems you haven’t solved. Do whatever you feel will produce the most interesting essay.

When describing a problem that you’ve solved, write it in such a way that anyone else encountering that problem will know how to solve it.

When describing a problem that you haven’t solved, write it in such a way that others can help you solve it.

I suggest you commit your essay every few minutes as you write it and review the published page in a browser to make sure you haven’t made any formatting mistakes.

Be sure to use formatting such as sections and links as appropriate. If you want to include code you can use fenced code blocks.

In the digits application about 90% of the material that is there feels foreign. This is a problem that can probably be sovled by going over the material over and over again but for somereason the blaze material of the application seems like it is going to take even more work to try and get a hold of. 

This would probably be my biggest problem that I havent solved yet. I still feel like I do not know enough about the meteor blaze language. The best way to really solve this problem is going to probably be trying to make a test app and trying to play around with features that can be found online. Other than that I just feel like it is a big mountain in front of me that I don’t know where to start at.

Till next key stroke
