In the digits application about 90% of the material that is there feels foreign. This is a problem that can probably be sovled by going over the material over and over again but for somereason the blaze material of the application seems like it is going to take even more work to try and get a hold of. 

This would probably be my biggest problem that I havent solved yet. I still feel like I do not know enough about the meteor blaze language. The best way to really solve this problem is going to probably be trying to make a test app and trying to play around with features that can be found online. Other than that I just feel like it is a big mountain in front of me that I don’t know where to start at. But with all mountains the first step to traversing it is one step in front of the other.

I guess the first problem is pretty vague so I guess I should narrow it down. Not a specific problem per se but the concept of implementing html while using javascript is a problem that I run into and using it to access data. I havent really solved the problem on my own because of watching the videos that accompany the WODs that we work on. But I hope to figure it out because it is probably going to help me in the future in the event that I run into a situation that will require me to learn a whole new complicated platform to create new material with. To add onto this problem I might want to add that I am just unsure about how information is being passed around, not the information specifically but what methods are they being passed around by? Are they just global and any information can be passed to another file as long as they have an import statement of said file? This just seems like things that I might not have to know at the moment but I probably won’t feel at ease until it feels like I have really gotten it down.

Till next key stroke
