Final Project Idea: resource-repository

The Problem: University of Hawaiâ€™i students often look to external resources to learn difficult material and do not find any resources relevant to what they would like to learn more about because of the broadness of information availible on the internet

The Solution: Create an online repository where students can login to view and submit links to various online resources.

The resource-repository will have a submit option, a view option, and an edit button

The submission will take in details that the resource has helped them. Some details can be as follows; department, class, teacher, subject, optional notes. After the submission has been entered into the website a moderator would have to approve the information to see that it is not an invalid link.

Such invalid links would include; irrelevant information, tests and or quizes for current year at university.

When viewing information you can navigate to the class that you are trying to seek resources for and it would display a table full of submissions and relevant information such as notes.

An edit button would be availible to the user who has submitted the link and the user would be able to edit information that may have been entered incorrectly in their initial submission.

Important design goal for Study Buddy are:
-To encourage sharing of online resources to fellow students
